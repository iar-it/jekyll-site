    Due to the Raleigh Marathon on Sunday morning, <strong>the following roads will be closed</strong> which will affect your driving direction to Fairgrounds:
<ul>
<li>Hillsborough Street will be closed east of Blue Ridge Road (from Blue Ridge Road to downtown Raleigh) from 7:00am to 10:00am. <strong>There will be no access to Hillsborough Street from I-440 (Beltline) in either direction</strong>.</li>

<li>Blue Ridge Road northbound lanes (K-Mart to Rex Hospital) will be closed between Hillsborough Street and Wade Avenue. The southbound lanes (Rex Hospital to K-Mart) will be open. This closure also includes the exit ramp from westbound Wade Avenue to Blue Ridge Road. <strong>If you are on Wade Avenue driving away from Downtown Raleigh, you will not be able to exit onto Blue Ridge Road</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Based on the above road closures and the traffic flow restrictions, we suggest the following directions to State Fairgrounds:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are coming from North Raleigh on I-440: 
<ul>
<li>Exit at Wade Avenue towards the airport.</li>
<li>Pass the exit for Blue Ridge Road (the ramp will be closed).</li>
<li>Exit at Edwards Mill Road and turn left at Edwards Mill Road.</li>
<li>You will have two options to reach the State Fairgrounds:
<ul></li>
<li>Turn left immediately after the Wade Avenue bridges and take Wade Avenue toward Downtown Raleigh. Then exit onto Blue Ridge Road and turn right on Blue Ridge Road. Enter Gate 11 at Blue Ridge Road.</li>
<li>Continue on Edwards Mill Road and turn left onto Trinity Road. Enter Gate 9 at Trinity Road.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>

<li>If you are coming from Cary, Holly Springs or Fuquay-Varina using I-440:
<ul>
<li>Exit at Western Boulevard towards Cary </li>
<li>Turn right at Blue Ridge Road. </li>
<li>Turn left at Hillsborough Street and enter Gate 2. </li>
</ul></li>

<li>If you are coming from Cary, Morrisville or Durham using I-40, NC-54, or Hillsborough Street, there will be no changes in your driving directions to the State Fairgrounds. 
</li>
</ul>

<p>For your convenience, Raleigh police officers will be on the streets to assist and direct you to the Fairgrounds gates.</p>
