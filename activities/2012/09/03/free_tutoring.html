    <h1>MYC Complimentary Community Tutoring Program</h1>

<p>As part of our focus on developing the educational and leadership background of our youth as outstanding and legendary global citizens, we are initiating, inn shaa'a Allaah, a Complimentary (i.e., free of charge) Community Tutoring Program.

<p>The tutoring program will focus in directing students towards effective strategies and resources that will help them develop confidence and independence in terms in their education, and anywhere else for that matter, inn shaa'a Allaah.

<p>The goal is to eventually have this service accessible, free-of-charge, to anyone up until college, and beyond, inn shaa'a Allaah.  As an initiation, we will be focusing on the Elementary / Middle School Girls and Boys, and then expand as soon as we are able to, inn shaa'a Allaah.  Please let us know if you or anyone you know is willing to be a part of this program in any way, inn shaa'a Allaah.

<br/><br/>

<h3>Who</h3>
<p>Tutoring is currently being offered only to Elementary / Middle School Girls and Boys. If you are interested in signing up for tutoring, please fill out the <a href="http://goo.gl/X71UN">Student Registration Form</a>

<br/><br/>

<h3>Planned Schedule</h3>

<p>Our tentative schedule is to start offering tutoring services beginning the week of  September 12, 2012</p>
 
<ul>
<li>Wednesdays:  4:30 PM - 5:30 PM
<li>Fridays:  4:00 PM - 5:30 PM
<li>Additional Days/Times TBD, if necessary
</ul>

<br/><br/>

<h3>Volunteer Tutors</h3>

<p>Because volunteers can receive credit for service hours (e.g., community service hours, honors society service hours requirements, etc.), this is an awesome opportunity for those of us that are wanting to become increasingly attached to our masjid while receiving something in addition to our hasanaat, which are from Allaah as long as we do this for Allaah's sake alone, inn shaa'a Allaah.

<p>The tutors will be primarily college students, including those majoring in areas related to the various sciences, mathematics, English, history and social sciences, foreign languages, and others, inn shaa'a Allaah.

<p>If you are interested in offering your services as a Volunteer Tutor please fill out the   <a href="http://goo.gl/RezB7">Volunteer Tutor Registration Form</a>
