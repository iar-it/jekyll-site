<p>The IAR Sports Committee is once again proud to sponsor the Fall 2013 Men's (over 30) Basketball League.

<p><b>Who:</b> Participation in the league is restricted to men over 30 years of age.
  
<p><b>Where:</b> The games will be held at the IAR gym
 
<p><b>Dates:</b> February 10 through June 23 2013 (Final dates to be determined)
 
<p><b>Time:</b> The league games will be held every Sunday. Game times will vary according to your team. Games times will be either from Asr to Maghrib or from Maghrib to Isha. There will be time available after Isha for additional games or playoff games as the schedule plays out.

<p><b>Costs:</b> Dues to participate in the league for the Spring session are $25 per person. This will cover the cost of jersey fees and administrative fees for the IAR Sports Committee. If we have left over funds, we will try to provide refreshments or gift cards for the top finishing team.

<p><b>Number of participants:</b> We will restrict the number of participants to 24. This will allow for four teams of six players each. However on the court there will be five players at a time with one player as a substitute.  

<p>The registration for Spring 2013 season has been completed and teams have been randomly put together through a blind draw.

<p>Through the discretion of the majority, if there is an "unfair" advantage or disadvantage, teams may be adjusted to allow for competitive balance.

<p>It's understandable that members of a particular team may not be able to participate one particular weekend. If this is the case, it is up to the team members to find a replacement player for the game. This can be from any other registered member of the league.
