    <p>The following are articles written by Imam Baianonie.</p>

<a href="/services/Differences_in_Fiqh_Made_Easy_Part_I_&_II.pdf">Differences in Fiqh Made Easy Part I and II (pdf)</a>
<p>A 218 page book on the various fiqh differences in At-Tahaarah (Purification) &
As-Salaah (Prayer)</p>

<a href="/imam/umrah-guide.html">Step by Step Guide for Umrah</a>
<p>A detailed guide explaining all of the obligatory and recommended actions while performing Umrah to the House of Allah (SWT).</p>

<a href="/imam/zakaat-ul-maal.html" title="Zakat-ul-mal (Zakat)">Zakat-ul-mal (Zakat)</a>
<p>Zakat purifies the heart from the detested trait of stinginess, and also purifies the wealth by giving out a portion of that wealth.  It also causes the wealth to grow through Allah's blessings.  While regular charity is strongly recommended and abundantly rewarded by Allah (SWT), Zakat is a debt we owe Allah (SWT), and must be paid as a part of our belief in Him.</p>

<a href="/imam/fiqh-ramadan.html" title="Rules of the Fasting of Ramadan">Rules of the Fasting of Ramadan</a>
<p>Fasting the month of Ramadaan is one of the main pillars of Islaam. It is obligatory upon every sane, healthy Muslim whose reached puberty and is not traveling during the time of fasting. As for women, they must not fast if they are menstruating or having post-childbirth bleeding.</p>

<a href="/imam/fiqh-ramadan-with-evidences.html" title="Fiqh of Fasting of Ramadan">Fiqh of Fasting of Ramadan</a>
<p>Allah ﷻ says in the Qur'an what may be interpreted as, "O you who believe, fasting is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you so that you may achieve Taqwah (righteousness, God-fearing)."</p>

<a href="/islam/how-do-i-pray.html" title="How do I pray?">How do I pray?</a>
<p>Salah is the second pillar of Islam. It refers to the five compulsory daily prayers. Salah is offered five times a day individually or in congregation. We offer Salah to remember Allah. It brings us closer to Him. Allah says in the Noble Qur'an, what can be translated as, "Establish Salah to remember Me (Allah)." (20:14)</p>

<a href="http://www.islam1.org/articles/step_by_step_guide_for_hajj_and_umrah.html" title="Step by Step Guide for Hajj and Umrah">Step by Step Guide for Hajj and Umrah</a>
<p>Eh-raam is mandatory (waajib). Male pilgrims must take off their regular clothes and put on the two unstitched pieces of clothes (Ezaar and Redaa). They cannot wear shoes that cover the top of their feet. Female pilgrims can wear any loose-fitting decent dress covering the entire body except face and hands.</p>

<a href="/imam/basic-rules-of-islamic-funeral.html" title="The Basic Rules of Islamic Funerals">The Basic Rules of Islamic Funerals</a>
<p>The following are some of the issues facing the family members and relatives of deceased individuals. It is requested that Muslims be familiar with these issues at all times since death can approach anyone at any given time or place.</p>
<p>I ask Allah (SWT) to bestow on us sincerity in our speech and actions, to forgive our mistakes, and to place us with His pious servants; and for Him to listen and grant us what we ask for. We must always say--All praise be to Allah, the Lord of the worlds.</p>


<a href="/imam/fiqh-moon-sighting.html" title="Islamic Rules and Basis for Determining the Beginning and End of Ramadan">Islamic Rules and Basis for Determining the Beginning and End of Ramadan</a>
<p>Just as fasting the month of Ramadan is a pillar of Islaam, the criteria that marks the start and end of Ramadan is set by Islam as well. The crescent moon marks the beginning of each lunar month in Islam, as Allah ﷻ stated in the Qur'an in what may be translated as, "They ask you [O Muhammad] about the crescent moons, Say, 'They are measurements of time for the people and for hajj (pilgrimage).'"</p>

<a href="/imam/prayer-for-newlyweds.html" title="A Prayer for Newlyweds">A Prayer for Newlyweds</a>
<p>O' our Lord! Bestow on us spouses and offspring who will be the comfort of our eyes, and make us leaders for the pious people. O' Allaah, make these newlyweds and all of us from among those who obey You and obey Your Messenger; and make us from among those who strive to attain Your pleasure and keep us away from Your wrath. Surely we are from You and for You.</p>

<a href="/islam/zakat-ul-fitr.html" title="Zakat-ul-Fitr">Zakat-ul-Fitr</a> 
<p>Zakat-ul-Fitr, the charity of breaking the fast, is obligatory on each Muslim young or old, male or female, rich or poor, if he owns extra food that exceeds the needs of him and his dependents for a period of twenty-four hours.</p>

<a href="/imam/friday-eid-prayers.html" title="Friday prayer and Eid prayer occurring on the same day">Friday prayer and Eid prayer occurring on the same day</a>
<p>If the day of Eid occurs on Friday, then Friday prayer is no longer an obligation upon those who performed the Eid prayer.</p>

<a href="http://www.islam1.org/articles/a_prayer_for_universal_peace.html" title="A Prayer for Universal Peace">A Prayer for Universal Peace</a>
<p>In response to unrest in the Middle East, The Islamic Association of Raleigh along with with other faith and non-profit organizations, joined to participate in a "Hope for Middle East Peace Community Prayer Day"...</p>

<a href="http://www.islam1.org/articles/eidulfitr_2006.html" title="Eid-ul-fitr 2006">Prophet Muhammad is a Mercy for al-'Alameen</a> 
<p>Eid speech delivered by Imam Mohamed Baianonie of the Islamic Center of Raleigh on October 23 2006</p>

<a href="http://www.islam1.org/articles/building_the_muslim_family_section_i.html" title="Building the Muslim Family (Part I)">Building the Muslim Family (Part I)</a> 
<p>The deterioration of the family not only affects the spouses, but it inevitably affects the whole family and even the whole community.  This could mean the destruction of society and the failure to pass on Islam to the next generation.</p>

<a href="http://www.islam1.org/articles/building_the_muslim_family_section_ii.html" title="Building the Muslim Family (Part II)">Building the Muslim Family (Part II)</a>
<p>The Muslim family deteriorates when its members are ignorant about the Islamic teachings of how a Muslim family should conduct their lives.</p>
