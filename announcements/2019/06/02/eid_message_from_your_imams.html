    <p>Assalamu alaikum,</p>

<p>The Islamic Association of Raleigh (IAR) is delighted to congratulate you on the upcoming arrival of the Eid-ul-Fitr celebration.  Our Eid prayers will occur on Tuesday, June 4th at the Exposition Center at the Fairground in two shifts. The first shift gathering is at 6:30 am and prayer at 7:30 am sharp. The second shift gathering is at 8:30 am and prayer is at 9:30 am sharp.</p>

<p>This year, we are especially thankful to observe the Eid holiday in unity with a number of masajid in the Triangle region, as per the declaration of the Triangle Imams Council shared with you before Ramadan.</p>

<p>By taking the matter up with regional masajid, we have taken a step towards regional unity.  We have also continued to emphasize the importance of religious references by adopting a criterion approved by major scholars on the Fiqh Council of North America, European Council for Fatwa and Research, and meeting conditions of the latest fatwa by the Assembly of Muslim Jurists of America (AMJA).</p>

<p>You will find many Muslims across the United States celebrating Eid with us, as this methodology is now adopted more broadly than any other by masajid among the 2,000+ across the United States.  Nonetheless, with the possibility of having multiple dates for Eid across the US and the world, we remind you that tolerating Fiqh differences is among the most important of Islamic ethics and upholding the unity of Muslims takes precedence above any valid difference of Fiqh opinions.  We should treat one another and our sister masajid with utmost respect.</p>

<p>Remember the important obligation of Zakat-ul-Fitr of $13 per member of your household, including children, that must be paid before Eid prayers.  In cooperation with our fellow imams on the Triangle Imams Council, Triangle-area masajid have unified these amounts across the region based on Islamic and market research, alhamdulillah.</p>

<p>From our family to yours, Eid Mubarak!</p>

<p>Your brothers,<br>
Imam Mohamed AbuTaleb<br>
Imam Muamar Dahnoun</p>
