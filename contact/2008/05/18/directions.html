    <h3>The Islamic Center of Raleigh</h3>
<p>We are located at <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&time=&date=&ttype=&q=808+Atwater+St,+Raleigh,+NC+27607&sll=35.750101,-78.685371&sspn=0.012364,0.012639&ie=UTF8&s=AARTsJoLl3fIFyRY7AF6GDIoHJO60n7D9w&view=map">808 Atwater Street, Raleigh NC 27607</a>. You can reach us by phone at 919 834-9572 or by email at <a href="mailto:office@islam1.org?subject=Questions+about+the+Islamic+Center">office@islam1.org</a></p>

<p>We are nestled between NC State University campus and I-440.  Parking during  Friday prayers is very limited.  To alleviate the parking problem we offer three shifts of Friday prayers.  It is highly recommended to car pool during Friday prayers.  NC State bus shuttle stops right at our door.</p>

<p>The Islamic Center of Raleigh has two buildings.  The red brick building facing Ligon Street and the newer white building facing Atwater Street.  The prayer services and events are held in the new white building, also known as the masjid. 

<p>You can enter the main building from either Ligon Street or Atwater Street.  The Multipurpose Hall / Gym, the Library and the  IAR Offices are located on the first floor of the masjid.  Women's Prayer Hall is on the second floor of the masjid. The doors for the masjid are open daily for the five prayers. </p>

<p>Al Iman School, An-Noor Quran Academy, and Al Furqan School are located in the main building and the red brick building.

<p>The masjid building also has a cafeteria "Al Ma'idah Kitchen" which serves Middle Eastern lunch and dinner daily for the community members.  The Al Ma'idah kitchen is located on the right hand corner as you enter the premises from Atwater Street.</p>
