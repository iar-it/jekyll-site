<h3><a href="majlis-alshura.html">Majlis Al-Shura</a></h3>
<p>The Majlis Al-Shura comprises a group elected from the general body to appoint, oversee, guide, and direct the work of the executive committees. The Shura is appointed for a three year term by the members of the Islamic Association of Raleigh.</p>

<h3><a href="executive-committee.html">The Executive Committee</a></h3>
<p>The executive committee oversees the day to day operation of the Islamic Association of Raleigh. They are selected by the Shura for a three year term. The Executive Committee consists of the Shura Chair, Vice-Chair, Secretary, and Treasurer, as well as the Chairpersons for all standing committees. Its duty is to implement the decisions of the Shura and coordinate the work of different committees.</p>

<h3><a href="board-of-directors.html">Board of Directors</a></h3>
<p>The board of directors consists of five members elected (for life) by the Shura, whose objective is to ensure that the IAR is functioning in compliance with its Constitution.</p>

<h3>Shura Meetings</h3>
<p>The IAR Shura meetings are held on second Sundays of every month at 2:00 PM in Conference Room #240. These meetings are open to community members to observe and attend. Meetings typically have a specific agenda with follow-up items from previous meetings and new items.</p>

<p>In order to make it easier for community members to participate on an ad-hoc basis, we have introduced a "Community Speaks Out" agenda item. This will give our community members opportunity to share their concerns or ideas with the shura.</p>

<p>A maximum of three people can participate in "Community Speaks Out" in one shura meeting. These will be selected on a first come first serve basis. Participating members will need to adhere to the guidelines of the meetings which will be provided to them.</p>

<!--<p>Once the Shura approves the meeting minutes, they are posted on the <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/islam1.org/meeting-minutes/files">Meeting Minutes website</a> for the purpose of full disclosure and openness to the community members.</p>-->
