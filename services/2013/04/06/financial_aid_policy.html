    <h3>Financial Aid Policy of the IAR Social & Welfare Committee</h3>

<ol>

<li>Financial Aid is provided from Zakat funds and therefore can be given only to

individuals/applicants who qualify to receive Zakat. It is the responsibility of the Social 

& Welfare Committee to assess an applicant's Zakat eligibility and will deny any 

applications that they determine to be non-Zakat eligible.</li>

<li>To determine if an individual is Zakat-eligible, the Social & Welfare Committee requires 

documentation (such as bank statements, tax returns, paystubs, etc). Depending on 

circumstances additional documentation can be requested. If the required documentation 

does not exist the applicant needs to provide a valid and verifiable reason (proof) for the 

application to be considered.</li>

<li>The Social & Welfare Committee conducts interviews with the applicants to understand 

their situation to help in final decision making. Only the applicant, and his/her spouse or 

immediate family members can attend the interviews with the Social & Welfare 

Committee interviewers.</li>

<li>The Social & Welfare Committee requires 2 weeks for processing the application after all 

information on the form and required documentation is complete.</li>

<li>The Social & Welfare Committee can verify the applicant's information by running a 

credit check. By filling the form and signing it, the applicant authorizes the Social and 

Welfare Committee to investigate the applicants situation and income including 

performing a credit check and obtaining a credit report.</li> 

<li>Only individuals residing within the greater Raleigh area are eligible to apply for 

Financial Aid with IAR Social & Welfare Committee. Applications from outside Raleigh 

(like Durham, Chapel Hill) can be considered on a case-by-case basis.</li> 

<li>The Social & Welfare Committee of IAR does not provide funds directly to an applicant 

who requests monetary assistance. Checks are not written directly to the applicant but are 

written in the name of the third party to whom the applicant must pay. The IAR does not 

provide any cash payments to financial aid applicants. An applicant must provide a lease 

contract, bills, or other statements and documentation for which financial aid is being 

requested so that the amount and eligibility of the expense can be verified by Social & 

Welfare Committee staff.</li> 

<li>The Social & Welfare Committee of IAR does not provide funds to pay taxes on behalf 

of others (example, income tax due or property tax)</li> 

<li>The Social & Welfare Committee of IAR does not provide funds to cover airfare 

expenses or any immigration related fees (example, work authorization application fees).</li> 

<li>Financial Aid will only be provided to applicants who entered USA legally or are in the

US legally. The applicant must bring a government issued picture ID and the Social 

Security card at the time of interview.</li> 

<li>Any payments towards bills which incur interest amounts or late fee need to be adjusted 

accordingly to take out such amounts. Social & Welfare Committee does not pay for 

interest or late fee of any sorts.</li> 

<li>Social & Welfare Committee has the right to deny any applications which request 

financial aid for items that are considered to be non-essential (example cable-TV 

service), or for those items that have alternative solutions, or are considered to be of 

entertainment value/purpose.</li> 

<li>The general rule to receive financial assistance through Social & Welfare Committee is 

once for every 12-month period. The maximum dollar amount limit per 

individual/applicant/family is $1,200 or other amount considered as reasonable to cover 

eligible expenses/bills. Both the frequency and the limit can be reviewed for special 

circumstances. However, this is by exception and requires the Social & Welfare 

Committee Chairperson's approval.</li> 

<li>The decision of approval or denial rests with the Social & Welfare Committee. If the 

applicant disagrees with the decision the applicant can file an appeal in writing stating 

their reasons to the Chairperson of Social & Welfare Committee. Any misconduct, anger 

bursts, misbehavior or lack of cooperation by an applicant or his/her spouse/relatives can 

disqualify the applicant from receiving financial aid.</li> 

<li>Anyone who has received Financial Assistance through Social & Welfare Committee is 

not eligible to join Social & Welfare Committee to be a volunteer/staff member on the 

Committee for a period of 2 years from the date of receiving assistance.</li>
