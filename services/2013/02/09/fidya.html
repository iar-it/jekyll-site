    <p>If one does not fast some days during Ramadan, it is obligatory to make up these missed fasts before the next Ramadan arrives, regardless of whether these fasts were missed with a valid excuse (e.g., travel, sickness, etc.) or without a valid excuse.  

<p>If one is not able to fast or does not make up for them before the next Ramadan due to long-term/chronic illness, one must pay a compensation (Fidya) by feeding a poor person for every day of fasting not observed.
 
<p>The Social & Welfare Committee has started a new program entitled "Fidya". Under this program the Social & Welfare Committee collects money towards Fidya and distributes Fidya among those qualified to receive Zakat (poor and needy) in the local Community in the form of dry rations. 

<p>The price for Fidya changes each year and is determined by IAR each Ramadan based on the cost of rations. For those who would like to take advantage of this service, envelopes marked "Fidya" with the amount that needs to be paid for each missed fast are kept outside the donation box in the lobby of the main IAR Building.  Please deposit the envelopes in the donation box.
