    <h2>FUNDED BY ZAKAT AND SADAQAH (NEEDY) FUND AT IAR</h2>

<p>A number of our Muslim Brethren are being forced to flee their home country due to fear of persecution, war, or violence. Upon arrival, these individuals and families need help settling down for the first few weeks or months until they secure employment or other means of income needed to become self-sufficient. The Social & Welfare Committee offers helps to Refugees arriving in our community for at least a period of one year or longer depending upon individual/family needs and circumstances.</p>

<p>Newly arrived refugees are normally put in touch with IAR Social & Welfare Committee through the sponsoring agency assigned by the US Government. Primarily, it is the Lutheran Foundation through which Refugees arrive in the Triangle area. The Social & Welfare Committee maintains regular contact with the Lutheran Foundation and is notified of new Refugees arrival in our area. However, if this has not been the case, please contact the Social & Welfare committee using the contact information provided on this website to inform of new Refugees.</p>

<p>The Social & Welfare Committee's Refugee Support Sub-committee works with the Lutheran Foundation to assist in helping the Refugees settle in the area by offering hot food/meal on the day of arrival, payment of rent, using community donated furniture and/or household items and purchasing of items through Social & Welfare Committee Funds to fulfil the basic needs of the Refugees like furniture, kitchen utensils, and clothes to help settle in their new homes. Social & Welfare Committee works with the local community and with the IAR Support Group to solicit donations of goods and funds to sustain this support to Refugees. </p>

<p>Requests for furniture and household items are also entertained for needy families/individuals already living in the area but preference and priority is given to Refugees in the area for less than one year.</p>
