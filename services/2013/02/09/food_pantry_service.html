    <p>The Food Pantry Service provides food for individuals and families who are in financial difficulty and are unable to afford to purchase adequate food for their needs.</p>

<p>Operations of Food Pantry are primarily supported through purchase of food by Social & Welfare Committee using the Needy Fund (Sadaqah) money donated by the Community and also from food donations by the community. Typical items distributed include but not limited to rice, cooking oil, sugar, flour, milk, eggs, juice and zabiha meat and special items like Dates during Ramadan.</p>

<p>We encourage community members to donate money to the IAR Needy Fund to support the activities of the IAR Food Pantry serving the needy and refugees in our community.
<br>
<br>
</p>

<h3>Who is eligible?</h3>
<p>This service is made available to all people - inside and outside the community, Muslim and non-Muslim. Food Packages are prepared and distributed to those in need.
<br>
<br>
</p>

<h3>How to apply for food pantry benefits?</h3>
<p>The objective of the Food Pantry Service is to reach as many needy people as possible; the amount of food given is proportionate to the size of the family.</p>
<p>Each participant is required to fill out forms and register with the Food Pantry on their first visit to receive this benefit.
<br>
<br></p>

<h3>Location and Hours</h3>
<p>The Food Pantry is located in the Al Iman School Building or the Red Brick Building facing Ligon Street.</p>
<p>The Food Pantry is open once a month - on the first of every month. During the month of Ramadan the Food Pantry is open every Saturday.</p>
<p>Hours of Distribution: 10:00 am to 12:00 pm.</p>
