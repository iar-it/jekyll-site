<p>The Islamic Association of Raleigh strives to provide an inclusive environment for our community members with special needs and disabilities. There are several projects underway to make our masjid welcoming to everyone and we encourage your participation and feedback.
<p>The main building has a wheelchair-accessible prayer hall and bathrooms, as well as elevator access to the upper floors. Alhamdulillah, with the support of our dedicated volunteers, IAR can say we are one of very few mosques in the country that offers a parent support group and Sunday school for special needs children. Please contact our Special Needs Facilitator, Sr. Arshiya Siddiqui, at <a href="mailto:specialneeds@islam1.org">specialneeds@islam1.org</a> with any questions.
