    <p>Assalamualaikum IAR members,</p>

<p>Alhamdolilah, we have recently returned from performing the Hajj via IAR and Adam Travel, and are writing this email to provide feedback to the IAR regarding our experience.</p>

<p>Specifically, we must begin by commending the efforts of Br. Muamar Dahnoun for his role as the Hajj coordinator/Group Leader for the IAR Hajj Group.  Br. Muamar made the entire experience hassle free, informative and a pleasure and we pray that Allah SWT reward him immensely for it.</p>

<p>From the beginning, Br. Muamar was incredibly informative and timely in providing all necessary information directly to Adam Travel.  Because of this, we never had to deal directly with Adam Travel and felt fortunate that Br. Muamar took care of all logistical details, paperwork etc. for us.</p>

<p>Given that this trip constitutes a once in a lifetime experience for most people - Br. Muamar's availability to answer all questions, address all issues and his constant accessibility via group lectures, email, phone or in person,  helped us make the most of preparing for the trip itself.  As a result, we felt that Br. Muamar worked diligently to ensure that we were as prepared as possible before we left.</p>

<p>On the trip itself, the Raleigh group interacted with other Adam Travel groups throughout the journey.  During the course of the trip, we met participants in other groups asking to join Br. Muamar's group because of their observations of his lectures, his organization skills and his general demeanor during the trip.  Many times people commented on how they wished their group leaders were as prepared and handled things as well as Br. Muamar.  As a result, we felt greatly privileged having him as our group leader.  He provided a perfect balance of step by step guidance with independent activity.</p>

<p>JazakAllah to Br. Muamar for his great efforts in making this trip a positive one for all participants.  His presence and sincerity added barakah to this entire trip.</p>

<p>Our experience with Adam Travel was also a positive one.  Our accommodations, travel arrangements and all logistical details were more than expected and the Adam Travel staff on the ground in Makkah were very helpful and cordial.</p>

<p>JazakAllah to IAR's efforts for putting together a great Hajj package for our community and for making the trip such a success.  We are fans of this package and will speak highly of it to all our friends and relatives intending on performing the Hajj in the coming years inshallah!</p>

<p>JAK<br>
