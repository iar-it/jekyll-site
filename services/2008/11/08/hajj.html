<p>Allah SWT says in Surah Ali Imran verse 97</p>

<p>فيه آيات بينات مقام إبراهيم ومن دخله كان آمنا ولله على الناس حج البيت من استطاع إليه سبيلا ومن كفر فإن الله غني عن العالمين</p>

<p>Translation of the meaning: "And Hajj to the House (Ka'bah) is a duty that mankind owes to Allah, those who can afford the expenses (for one's conveyance, provision and residence); and whoever disbelieves, then Allah stands not in need of any of the 'Alamin"</p>

<p>Last year over 3 million Muslims completed the important obligation of performing Hajj. Included in this large gathering were twenty members of our community travelling as a group to help and support each other. Imam Muamar accompanied them and served as their guide and leader.</p>

<br/><br/>

<h3>Why should you perform Hajj with the Raleigh Hajj Group?</h3>

<p>The Raleigh Hajj Group is a service offered to the community in order to help them fulfill the duty of performing Hajj. Imam Muamar and his team of volunteers select a travel group who puts together the entire Hajj packet including airplane tickets, hotel reservations, hajj ritual arrangements (tents, food, travel), and stay in Madinah. The travel agency also helps with the Hajj Visa.</p> 

<p>The Raleigh Hajj Group conducts training workshops for all Hajjis in order to get them prepared for the rituals (Arabic word is Manasik) and helps them to visualize the various aspects of performing Hajj. These free workshops are open for the entire community even if you are not performing hajj with our group. </p>

<p>During the hajj, our group is led by an experienced and knowledgeable leader to help us fulfill our obligation in a manner that is pleasing to Allah SWT. This is the most valuable service provided by us, you will always have somebody who can answer your questions and help you when you face hardships or become sick during hajj.</p>

<br/><br/>

<h3><a href="/services/hajj-program-details.html">Hajj 2017 Program</a></h3>

<p>For 2017, we have chosen <a href="http://www.adamtravel.com/">Adam Travel</a> for handling our travel arrangements. The tentative departure date from the US is August 21/22, 2017 and the tentative return back from Saudi Arabia is on September 5/6, 2017. For planning purposes, please be prepared to add or subtract one day to these dates. It would help to schedule at most three weeks leave from work.</p>

<p>This year Imam Muamar Dahnoun will accompany the IAR Raleigh Hajj Group as its logistic leader. Imam Muamar Dahnoun will be assigned as the logistic leader by Adam Travel for a larger group that will also include the IAR Raleigh Hajj Group.</p>

<p>Please review  <a href="/services/hajj-program-details.html">Hajj 2017 Program Details</a> page for more in depth information.</p>

<p>If you are interested in performing Hajj with the Raleigh Hajj Group, please fill out the following <a href="/services/hajj-pre-registration-form.html">Hajj Pre-Registration Form</a>. Filling this form does not reserve a seat, nor are you obligated to perform hajj with us. We will use this information to keep you informed as more details are finalized.</p>

<p>Once the Hajj package has been finalized, we will ask you to fill out a registration form with all of your passport details, copy of your passport, and request a deposit. Completing this step will reserve your seat.</p>

<p>We pray to Allah SWT that he helps you fulfill this obligation and that he accepts your Hajj. Ameen. Please remember to purify your intentions to worship Allah SWT alone and to ask for his help.</p>
