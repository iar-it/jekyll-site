    <p>The Social and Welfare Committee is responsible for providing programs and services to enhance living conditions of Muslims in adverse circumstances. 

<p>It manages the collection of Zakat and Sadaqah and makes sure that they are disbursed (according to the Islamic rules) to the needy people within the community including refugees, and also internationally, especially during times of crisis.

<p>Within its charter to aid the local and international community the Social & Welfare Committee also provides social services to help organize certain services such as Iftar during the month of Ramadan, Toys Drive at the time of Eid-ul- Fitr for the children of needy and refugees and Udhiyah/Qurbani at the time of Eid-ul- Adha.

<p>With the blessings of Allah (SWT) the Social & Welfare Committee is able to help the needy including refugees using Sadaqah (Needy) funds, and those who qualify, with Zakat funds donated by the community.

<p>Additionally, there are special fund drives to help victims of natural disasters and famine such as floods and earthquakes. Funds are also collected for the daily Iftar at Ramadan time.

<p>May Allah reward you all. Please continue to <a href="/donate/">donate</a>  generously to help your brothers and sisters in need.  And remember to make duwa for those in need and all the volunteers and staff.

<h3>Volunteers</h3>
<p>Without the help of Allah (swt) and the generosity of the community, this committee would not be able to function. There is always a need for active volunteers.

You will have the opportunity of working directly and closely with the community members in helping them with many different ways - helping newcomers get settled, providing transportation, helping get food to those who need it, working with families in difficult circumstances and desperately in need of financial support.
