    <h5>What is a Waqf?</h5>

<p>Waqf is a financial charitable institution established by withholding one's property to eternally spend its revenue on fulfilling certain needs depending on the choice and conditions made by the 'waqf' or the person who owns the property. 

<p>Simply a Waqf is where assets such as money or business holding or real estate are put aside for the benefit of the others and the future. 

<p><img src="/img/2018-iar-waqf.jpg" width="600">

<h5>History of Waqf in Islam</h5>

<p>The first religious waqf is the mosque of Quba' in Madinah, which was built upon the arrival of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) in 622 AD. The masjid stands now on the same location but with a new and enlarged structure. Six months later, Quba' was followed by the mosque of the Prophet (peace be upon him) in the center of Madinah. Mosques and real estates confined for providing revenues to spend on mosques' maintenance and running expenses are in the category of religious waqf.

<p>Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) encouraged 'sadaqa jariya', which also includes waqf. The Messenger of Allah (ï·º) said, "When a man dies, his deeds come to an end except for three things: Sadaqah Jariyah (ceaseless charity); a knowledge which is beneficial, or a virtuous descendant who prays for him (for the deceased)." Recorded in <a href="https://sunnah.com/riyadussaliheen/13/8">Sahih Muslim</a> narrated by Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him).  

<p>The religious origin of waqf in Islam started with a story of the second caliph Umar Ibn al Khattab when he was granted gardens after opening Khayber and came to the Prophet asking him about the best way to make the poor benefit from this land. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) advised him to eternally withhold the land and spend its revenue on the poor without being subject to be sent, nor donated nor inherited to anybody. Since this incident, waqf has been spread among Muslims at the time of the prophet and continued after him for long centuries.

<h5>Our Mission</h5>

<p><strong>Vision</strong></p>

<p>Inspired by the historical concept of a Waqf, an inalienable religious endowment, the Islamic Association of Raleigh aims to empower the long term financial health of the greater Raleigh Muslim community and provide halal financing collateral for strategic community development projects. 

<p><strong>Mission</strong></p>

<p>The Islamic Association of Raleigh Endowment is a private quasi-endowment fund established in 2008 by the Islamic Association of Raleigh Majlis Al-Shura. The Endowment's mission is to serve the Islamic Association of Raleigh by supporting selected programs for scholarships, education, community enhancement or other like-minded activities. 

<p><strong>Giving to Islamic Association of Raleigh</strong></p>

<p>An endowment fund is a permanent, self-sustaining source of funding. Endowment assets are invested, and each year a portion of the earnings is paid out for the purpose of the fund and the rest is used to build the fund's market value. In this way, an endowment fund can grow and can provide support for its designated purpose in perpetuity. When you establish an endowment fund, you create a permanent legacy of support for Islamic Association of Raleigh.
