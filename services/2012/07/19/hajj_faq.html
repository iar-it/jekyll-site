<h3>Frequently Asked Questions about preparations for Hajj</h3>

<br/><br/>

<p><b>1. When is the last day to register for Hajj?</b>
<p>Limited seats are available. Registration is based on first come first serve. Based on our prior experiences, some of our programs will be sold out insha Allah in first half of Ramadan and most will be sold out just after Eid time so please hurry and reserve your seat.
 
<br/>

<p><b>2. When will the embassy start issuing Hajj visas and how long will it take to get one?</b>
<p>Normally Saudi Embassy will start issuing Hajj visas 2-3 weeks after Ramadan and will continue doing so for about 4 weeks. Normally, Visa will take only 2-3 days for early birds but it will take up to 1-2 weeks for late comers. So, we advise you to register early so you can get your Visa early.

<br/>
 
<p><b>3. I will be traveling with my wife so what is the requirement for Hajj/Umrah Visa.</b>
<p>Please check regular Visa requirement plus you need to furnish us with a copy of your marriage certificate (please do not send original documents)

<br/>
 
<p><b>4. I do not have a Mahram (because I am not married or a widow or divorced) Can I go to Hajj?</b>
<p>If you are 45 years or older and can provide necessary documentation you can go to Hajj and the group will act as your Mahram.
 
<br/>

<p><b>5. I have a valid tourist Visa to Saudi Arabia for 5 years. Can I go to hajj using this Visa?</b>
<p>No, tourist Visa is not acceptable for Hajj.
 
<br/>

<p><b>6. Can a holder of an American H, R or student visa obtain Hajj Visa?</b>
<p>Yes with proper documents.
 
<br/>

<p><b>7. Can I pay for a Hajj package using my credit card?</b>
<p>No, Islamically, you cannot pay for Hajj using any form of credit (debt). So only acceptable form of payment is checks.
 
<br/>

<p><b>8. Can I stop over in my way to Hajj (or after Hajj) in my home country?</b>
<p>Yes you can. You may have to pay extra for the stop over depending on the Airlines. You may also encounter problems and inconvenience if you arrive in Saudi Arabia alone not accompanying our main group from USA.

<br/>

<p><b>9. What is the next step after I send my remaining balance and proper documents?</b>
<p>We will then start on your visa processing, which could take up to 2-3 weeks. Once everything is complete you will receive a package with you day-by-day itinerary, passport with visa, airline tickets, your identification card and luggage tags to place on your luggage.
 
<br/>

<p><b>10. Why do I need an ID card and special luggage tags?</b>
<p>You need to wear your  ID card tag at all times starting from your departure from USA until your return. It is very important that you do so, so any of Adams Travel representatives can recognize you in order assist you in any needs that you may require. The luggage tags are very valuable so the luggage can be identified throughout the trip.
 
<br/>

<p><b>11. What should I take with me to Hajj?</b>
<p>We recommend that you do not take too much luggage (one suit case per person). Weather is very mild in Saudi Arabia during Hajj so take only comfortable and light clothes. More information will be provided during the Hajj classes.
 
<br/>

<p><b>12. Can I use my credit card in Saudi Arabia?</b>
<p>Major Credit Cards are acceptable in hotels, major malls and jewelry shop.
 
<br/>

<p><b>13. How much cash should I take with me?</b>
<p>Theft and Pick Pocket is a major problem during Hajj, so the total amount of money (Cash & Travel Checks) that you need depends on the following, Is food covered in your program or not and the need for some emergency money. We suggest carrying $300-$500 plus the amount of gifts you are planning to purchase.
 
<br/>

<p><b>14. I am a new Muslim (Muslimah) with a non-Islamic name. Can I go to Hajj?</b>
<p>Yes, you can if you provide us with a copy of your "conversion to Islam" certificate or an official letter from IAR attesting to your conversion to Islam.
 
<br/>

<p><b>15. We lost (misplaced) our marriage certificate! Can we still go to Hajj?</b>
<p>Yes, all you have to do is to ask your local Islamic center to write an official letter certifying that you are known to them as "a husband and a wife".
 
<br/>

<p><b>16. What is the distance Makkah-Mina and Mina-Arafat?</b>
<p>The distance between Makkah and Mina is 8 kilometers or 5 miles. The distance between Mina and Arafat is 14.4 kilometers or 9 miles.
